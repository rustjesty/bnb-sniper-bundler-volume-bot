### What to Include

Please include the following information:

- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit it

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours
- **Status Update**: Within 7 days
- **Fix Timeline**: Varies based on severity

## Security Best Practices for Users

### Private Key Management

1. **Never share your private key** with anyone
2. **Never commit private keys** to version control
3. **Use separate wallets** for testing and production
4. **Keep private keys encrypted** when stored
5. **Use hardware wallets** for large amounts

### Environment Security

```bash
# ✅ GOOD: Use environment variables
PRIVATE_KEY=your_key_here

# ❌ BAD: Hardcoded in source
const privateKey = "0x1234..."; // NEVER DO THIS
```

### Transaction Safety

1. **Always test on forked networks** before mainnet
2. **Verify all transaction parameters** before signing
3. **Monitor gas prices** to avoid overpaying
4. **Set reasonable slippage limits**
5. **Double-check contract addresses**

### Smart Contract Security

1. **Audit all contracts** before deployment
2. **Test extensively** on testnets
3. **Follow established patterns** (OpenZeppelin, etc.)
4. **Understand MEV risks** and mitigation strategies
5. **Monitor deployed contracts** for unusual activity

### API and RPC Security

1. **Keep API keys secure** and rotate regularly
2. **Use HTTPS** for all RPC connections
3. **Implement rate limiting** where appropriate
4. **Monitor API usage** for anomalies
5. **Use dedicated RPC endpoints** for production

### Code Security

1. **Keep dependencies updated** and audit new ones
2. **Use reputable npm packages** only
3. **Enable 2FA** on GitHub and npm accounts
4. **Review code changes** before deployment
5. **Implement proper error handling**

## Known Security Considerations

### MEV (Maximal Extractable Value)

- This bot uses bloXroute for MEV protection
- Understand the risks of front-running and sandwich attacks
- Bundle transactions atomically when possible

### Slippage

- Always set appropriate slippage tolerance
- Be aware of price impact on large trades
- Monitor pool liquidity before trading

### Gas Management

- Implement gas price limits to prevent overpaying
- Monitor network congestion
- Use EIP-1559 when available

### Smart Contract Risks

- Contracts are immutable once deployed
- Always verify contract code before interaction
- Be aware of potential reentrancy attacks
- Understand approval mechanisms
