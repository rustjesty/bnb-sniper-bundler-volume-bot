## Overview

A sophisticated trading bot infrastructure designed for BNB Smart Chain, enabling automated token deployment, liquidity pool creation, and advanced trading strategies. Built with enterprise-grade tools and optimized for performance on PancakeSwap V3 and Four.meme platforms.

### Key Features

- **🚀 Token Deployment**: Automated ERC20 token creation with customizable parameters
- **💧 Liquidity Management**: Seamless pool creation and liquidity provisioning on PancakeSwap V3
- **⚡ Transaction Bundling**: bloXroute integration for MEV protection and atomic operations
- **🎯 Trading Strategies**: Support for sniping, bundling, and volume generation
- **🔒 Security First**: Built with OpenZeppelin contracts and comprehensive testing
- **🧪 Fork Testing**: BSC mainnet forking for realistic testing environment

---

## Architecture

This bot leverages a modular architecture combining:

- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity-based ERC20 token contracts
- **Transaction Bundling**: bloXroute API for atomic multi-transaction execution
- **Liquidity Protocols**: Uniswap V3 SDK for PancakeSwap V3 interaction
- **Development Framework**: Hardhat for compilation, testing, and deployment

### Technology Stack

| Component | Technology |
|-----------|-----------|
| Smart Contracts | Solidity ^0.8.9 |
| Framework | Hardhat ^2.19.5 |
| Testing | Hardhat Toolbox |
| DEX Integration | Uniswap V3 SDK |
| Security | OpenZeppelin Contracts |
| RPC Provider | QuickNode |
| MEV Protection | bloXroute |

## Prerequisites

Before running this project, ensure you have:

- **Node.js**: v16.x or higher
- **npm**: v8.x or higher
- **RPC Access**: QuickNode or similar BSC RPC endpoint
- **bloXroute Account**: API credentials for transaction bundling
- **Private Key**: Funded wallet on BNB Smart Chain

---

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/rustjesty/bnb-sniper-bundler-volume-bot
   cd bnb-sniper-bundler-volume-bot
   ```

2. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. **Configure environment variables**
   
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
   ```env
   PRIVATE_KEY=your_wallet_private_key
   AUTHORIZATION_HEADER=your_bloxroute_auth_token
   ```

4. **Update RPC endpoints** (if needed)
   
   Edit `hardhat.config.js` and `constants/index.js` with your RPC URLs

---

## Configuration

### Network Configuration

The project is configured to fork BNB Smart Chain mainnet for testing. Update `hardhat.config.js`:

```javascript
networks: {
  hardhat: {
    forking: {
      url: "YOUR_BSC_RPC_URL",
    },
  },
}
```

### bloXroute Setup

Update `constants/index.js` with your bloXroute credentials:

```javascript
export const BLOXROUTE_AUTHORIZATION_HEADER = 'your_auth_token'
export const BLOXROUTE_ENDPOINT = 'https://api.blxrbdn.com'
```

---

## Usage

### Development Server

Start a local Hardhat node with BSC fork:
```bash
npm run sn
```

### Run Tests

Execute test suite on local network:
```bash
npm run t
```

### Deploy Bot

Run the main bot script:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Manual Commands

```bash
# Compile contracts
npx hardhat compile

# Run specific script
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js

# Test with gas reporting
REPORT_GAS=true npx hardhat test

# Get help
npx hardhat help
```

## Security Considerations

⚠️ **Important Security Notes:**

1. **Never commit `.env` files** containing private keys or API tokens
2. **Use separate wallets** for testing and production
3. **Audit all transactions** before execution on mainnet
4. **Test thoroughly** on forked networks before live deployment
5. **Monitor gas prices** to avoid overpaying for transactions
6. **Understand MEV risks** when executing atomic bundles

---

## Workflow

The bot performs the following operations in an atomic bundle:

1. Deploy custom ERC20 token
2. Approve token for NFPM (Non-Fungible Position Manager)
3. Approve WBNB for NFPM
4. Create liquidity pool on PancakeSwap V3
5. Initialize pool with pricing
6. Add liquidity to pool
7. Execute buy transaction

All operations are bundled via bloXroute to ensure atomicity and MEV protection.
